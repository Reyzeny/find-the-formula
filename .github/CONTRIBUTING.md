# Contributing
The purpose of this project is slightly different from others.
The point of making this open source is so people can contribute formulas and number patterns to the JS file.
Any pattern or formula is allowed (the harder, the better) but it has to be something that's iterative and deals with numbers.
If you have an idea but you're not quite sure how to translate it to code, create an issue and I'll (or whomever else wants to help) will work with you. 

## Getting Started
**Step 1**:  Create an issue for the formula you want to include.

**Step 2**: Fork the repository and create a new branch with the same title as your formula.

**Step 3**: Follow the comments in the JS file to add your own formula and test if it works.

**Step 4**: Create a pull request for the branch.

**Step 5**: Once your PR is approved and merged, the formula will be included in the game.
